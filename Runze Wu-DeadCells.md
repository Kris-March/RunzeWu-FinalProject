The character gains resources to unlock a variety of game content, including equipment, ability variations, and more, while taking on adventures to kill monsters. In addition, the character meets various NPCS, all of whom go out of their way to help the protagonist.
Almost all of the help is paid, though, with crafting, merchants, and mutated NPCS demanding gold in exchange. So players need to constantly fight to unlock various game features, and then slowly get stronger while dying.

## Evaluation
“Dead Cells may be the most fun I've had in a game all year.”
9/10 – Polygon

“The game smartly dissects what’s so exciting about Metroidvanias (exploring labyrinthine levels packed with variety, unlocking new abilities that re-contextualize areas you already passed through) and reassembles those things around a compulsive roguelike core.” - Kotaku

“Dead Cells is worthy of its own invention. It’s not just a roguevania – it’s a damn good roguevania.” - Rock Paper Shotgun
